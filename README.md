The Aim of the research is to make a comparison between Biden's and Trump's use of twitter.

The source code supplied wordAnalysis.R contains the data collection aspects but these are commented out. You can use these if you wish to collect new data sets.

The Twitter authoirisation has also been removed.

The program is able to read in any one of four files.
The four files are available to be downloaded from this repo.
I suggest copying these to a local file director.
Then set you working directory.
The read section uses File.choose( ) to give some flexibility.
As is the code will run and does not need the Twitter authorisation, you will need this if you wish to gather your own twitter data.

A report is also available from the repo Comparison of Biden and Trump tweets.pdf
There is an error with the Markdown version which I have not been able to resolve, hence the pdf will show the kinds of processing and output.

The code is documented and hopefully can be followed.
